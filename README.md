1. The first step in machine learning is
selecting the kind of model that you'd like to use.

3. The model is the core component of machine learning,
and ultimately what we are trying to build. A model
might estimate how old a person is from a photo, predict
what you might like to see on social media, or decide
where a robotic arm should move.

3. You can think of a model as a function that accepts
data as an input and produces an output. More specifically,
a model uses input data to estimate something else.

4. We've learned that models are computer code that
processes information to make a prediction or a decision.

5. So that a computer can understand our objective,
we need to provide our goal as code snippet called
an objective function (also known as cost function).
Objective functions judge whether the model is doing a
good job (estimating boot size well) or bad job
(estimating boot size badly).
